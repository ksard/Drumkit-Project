Drumkit Project
This project was created as part of Section 13 of The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, available on Udemy. It serves as the fourth major project in the course curriculum. The Drumkit project mimics a drum set, featuring onscreen buttons that can be activated either by clicking or by pressing keys. This project provides an excellent opportunity to explore event listeners in JavaScript and further delve into the Document Object Model (DOM).
